# Movie API 
## A demonstration of using Spring Boot and MongoDB to create a basic API.
## This application uses Spring Boot and MongoDB
### To run this project, simply clone the repo and start both the `ApiApplication` and `index.html`. The `index.html` file will require you to view file in your IDE and click `Run 'index.html' with Coverage`. You will see a few browser icons show up in the IDE, simply click which browser you wish to launch the application into.
### This html page makes an API call to the backend and fetches the relevant movie data, and with Javascript, dynamically inserts it into the webpage.
### You will also need to use IDEA Ultimate Edition (free for students) for the project to add the DB. The project should add this and necessary dependecies by itself after hitting load/sync on the Maven sidebar.
